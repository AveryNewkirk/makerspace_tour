Hello, and welcome to the ITC Maker Space!
This is a space for Truist teammates to innovate, create, prototype, and collaborate using a variety of tools and technologies.
The wall near the door shows examples of items that have been made here.
We use our 3D printer to print awards for teammates and teams, as well as giveaways for events.
We also have a Cricut that we use to make stickers and t-shirts.
In addition, we have a laser engraver, which we are using to make aluminum business cards with QR codes as well as name plates engraved on acrylic or aluminum.
We also have several Raspberry pies, like the one that controls me, and several electronics kits for expanding the Raspberry pie functionalities.
The raspberry pies give us an interactive platform for developers to learn or expand their knowledge of Python and electronics.
We offer classes on the use of the equipment and encourage teammates to learn to use these tools on their own.
This space can also be reserved for team building events.
For more information, you can email us at ITC makerspace at truist dot com or visit our SharePoint site.
Thank you for visiting the maker space!
